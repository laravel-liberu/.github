## Support services  
While developing https://github.com/laravel-liberu/genealogy, we received many inquiries from developers and teams asking us about paid support. Some of these requests lead to fruitful collaborations, so we finally decided to launch such a paid support option.
If you need premium support when building your own applications with genealogy, we can help. Our support packages start at Â£200 per month, and include up to 8 hours of direct contact and support each month at no extra charge.
### With premium support you will get:

* First priority on having your issues addressed
* A private repo on our own GitHub organisation where you can host your project
* Help understanding the environment
* Help becoming more proficient when developing your projects
* Advice and mentoring
* Detailed code reviews
* Support and guidance on Laravel, Vue and Nuxt generally. 
* 1-2-1 assistance on version upgrades
* Direct communication via Slack (during our office hours only)
* We have 4 members on our dedicated support team, so there should be little if any waiting!
